	<li>2.1: 18-September-2011. Adjustments of resizing the dialog.</li>

	<li>3.0.0 5-November-2011. Rewritten to fit correctly with the CKEditor dialogs without using the iframe as that's not properly supported by CKEditor (see versions 2.1 and 2.2)<br>
	The browser functionality requires a CKEditor version &gt; 3.6.2, because there was <a href="http://dev.ckeditor.com/changeset/7296">a bug</a> that I fixed for this plugin.</li>
	<li>3.1.0 15-November-2011. Automatically detect CKEditor version to avoid problems with "browse server" button<br>

	<li>3.5.5 19-April-2013 Show the image correctly if it was resized with attributes instead of inline styles.<br>
				Adjust correctly the 4.1 ACF (the "url" attribute doesn't exist, I'm stupid).<br>
				Detect correctly v4 to avoid huge dialogs and provide better layout<br>
				Adjusted the language files so the plugin can be compiled correctly with a local install of CKBuilder<br>
